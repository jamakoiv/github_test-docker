Project for learning more advanced Git/Github.

Goals:
    - protecting main-branch.
    - CD/CI automated testing.
    - Pull requests to main from different branches.
    - Allow merging to main only if tests complete succesfully.
    - Create docker-container after tests complete succesfully.
    - Rebasing and appending to rewrite history to get rid of unnecessary commits.
